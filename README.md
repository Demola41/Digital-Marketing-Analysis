## 1. Situation
Analyzed marketing campaign data with a total budget of **$30.59M** across various channels to evaluate spending efficiency and customer acquisition effectiveness.
## 2. Task
The goal was to calculate key financial metrics specifically **Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)**, **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**, and **Cost Per Lead (CPL)** to distinguish high performing strategies from money losing ones.
## 3. Action
Developed a **Power BI** dashboard using **DAX** to compute custom financial metrics.
* **Funnel Analysis:** Visualized the full conversion path from Impressions to Orders.
* **Trend Analysis:** Analyzed revenue trends by day of the week and campaign type to identify peak performance windows.
## 4. Results & Insights
* **Top Revenue Driver:** Influencer campaigns generated the highest revenue (**$21.1M**).
* **Most Efficient Channel:** YouTube delivered the highest efficiency with a **277% ROMI**.
* **Underperformance:** Facebook campaigns were identified as a loss-maker with a **-34% ROMI**.
## 5. Recommendation
* **Budget Reallocation:** Immediately reallocate the Facebook ad budget into YouTube and Influencer channels.
* **Strategic Focus:** This shift will eliminate the -34% ROI loss and scale the high-efficiency campaigns that are already proven to work.
